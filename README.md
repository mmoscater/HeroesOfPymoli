* It can be noted when comparing the most popular items to the most profitable, that they are not directly correlated. This can mean that the most popular items may not always be the most expensive. With that being said, both the most profitable and popular item sold is the "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm". This item has been purchased a total of 12 times, producing a Total Value of \$50.76.

* With the largest age demographic being 20-24 it would be easy to see that the largest volume of purchases are in that age range. However, by average total purchase per person, it is actually the 35-39 age group that ranks highest, with the next highest being the age range of <10.
